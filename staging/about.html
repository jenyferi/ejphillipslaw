He also represents many contractors, owners and suppliers on local commercial and residential projects in the San Francisco Bay area region.
            <br><br>
            Eric has served as a lead counsel on a number of the nation’s largest construction disputes, including representing an international infrastructure developer in litigation on a public / private partnership project with nearly $700 million at risk.
            <br><br>
            His experience with hospital construction disputes and high-stakes litigation is unparalleled. In that regard, he has represented hospital owners that rank among the largest in the United States and the world.
            <br><br>
            Specific areas of his construction law expertise include: hospital construction and OSHPD issues; delay claims; scope and change order disputes; lost productivity claims; differing site conditions; defective design and construction disputes; electrical and chemical engineering failures, HVAC design and construction defects; material failures; workplace and environmental hazards; geotechnical and soil engineering defects; structural and civil engineering design disputes; water intrusion and mold claims; all forms of construction-related damages and civil / criminal penalties; state and federal false claims act matters; prompt payment act and lien claims; economic loss resulting from substandard human factors in the workplace; marine dredging; and a variety of designer, contractor and supplier negligence disputes, among others.
            <br><br>
